 * task credits its worker at most once, no matter how many paths observe the
 * settlement (a /finalize retry after a lost response, the /verdict route, the
 * DisputeResolved listener). Without it, settle-then-credit retries and the
 * event listener could each credit the same payout.
 *
 * Persists to Redis (agentStore) so the /agents endpoint can surface these
 * stats to the UI without re-deriving from on-chain history. If anything in
 * here fails we log + continue: the worker still gets paid on chain — only the
