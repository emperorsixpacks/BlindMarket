 * Record a successful task completion on the executor's record: bump

 * of the escrow (gross amount minus platform fee).
 *
 * The on-chain id and gross amount are resolved by the CALLER (which has already
 * confirmed the task is indexed + settled on-chain) and passed in — this
 * function never does its own getTaskIdByHash lookup. That closes the
 * "3 tasks · 0 0G" drift: previously tasksCompleted was bumped unconditionally
 * while totalEarnedRaw was only written if a SECOND, internal getTaskIdByHash
 * happened to resolve.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENT per task: a Redis NX marker (a2a:credited:<taskHash>) guarantees a
 * task credits its worker at most once, no matter how many paths observe the
 * settlement (a /finalize retry after a lost response, the /verdict route, the
 * DisputeResolved listener). Without it, settle-then-credit retries and the
 * event listener could each credit the same payout.
 *
 * Persists to Redis (agentStore) so the /agents endpoint can surface these
 * stats to the UI without re-deriving from on-chain history. If anything in
 * here fails we log + continue: the worker still gets paid on chain — only the
 * UI counter is at risk.
