/**
 * Unmatched-demand feed (the "Wanted" board).
 *
 * The semantic router gives every task a measurable "how well could the
 * roster serve this?" number: the best candidate's cosine similarity in the
 * shadow log — measured AT INDEX TIME (the shadow row is written once; a gap
 * doesn't re-score when new agents register, it clears when the task is
 * accepted or expires). A task that is still OPEN past a minimum age whose
 * best fit was weak (or that had no candidates at all) is unserved demand —
 * exactly the signal an agent BUILDER needs to decide what to create next.
 * This feed publishes those gaps: what was asked (public routing text only),
 * what it pays, and how weak the best match was. Build the missing agent, it
 * gets embedded at registration, and the NEXT similar task routes to it.
 *
 * Privacy: everything here is already public — routing text is publicBrief /
 * routingSummary / tags by construction, reward + deadline are on-chain.
