/**
 * Proof re-key (the semantic era's trust plumbing).
 *
 * Old world: proof — skill_stats rows and auto-'earned' badges — was keyed by
 * the task's declared capability TAGS at settlement. Semantic routing makes
 * tags optional, so semantically routed tasks increasingly settle with no
 * tags at all, and the worker's track record silently stops accruing exactly
 * as the marketplace stops needing tags. This module closes that hole: at
 * settlement, the task's PUBLIC routing text is matched (cosine, one batched
 * embedMany call per settlement) against the worker's installed PUBLIC skills
 * and the closest one above a floor is credited alongside any declared tags.
 *
 * Deliberate v1 bounds:
 * - Slug keys are NAMESPACED ('skill:<slug>') in skill_stats/agent_badges —
 *   author-chosen slugs share a TEXT keyspace with the capability enum, and
 *   four tags (translation, summarization, testing, scheduling) are
 *   themselves valid slugs; without the prefix a stranger's skill named
 *   'testing' would merge into (and poison) the QA tag's proven counts.
 * - Only PUBLIC registry skills participate. skill_stats/badges are readable
 *   unauthenticated, so crediting a private draft skill would leak its slug;
 *   and skill INSTRUCTIONS are author IP (stripped from every /agents
 *   response), so matching uses name + tags only — instructions never leave
 *   the platform through this path.
 * - Top-1 credit only. A task exercising two skills credits the closer one;
 *   credit-all-above-floor risks over-crediting and can be revisited with
 *   real distribution data.
 * - The CURRENT skill loadout is matched, not a task-time snapshot — a skill
 *   installed between accept and settlement can absorb the credit. Accepted
 *   for v1: the work itself was real and paid, only the per-skill attribution
 *   is gameable, and a task-time snapshot needs accept-time state we don't
 *   keep.
 *
 * Cost honesty: the embed memo's 5-min TTL rarely spans settlements, so
 * steady state is ONE batched provider call (task text + ≤10 short skill
 * lines) per settlement, bounded by the 10s fetch timeout. Callers run this
 * fire-and-forget — proof enrichment must never block a payout.
